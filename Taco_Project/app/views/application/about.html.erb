<h1>ðŸŒ® ABOUT TACOCAT ðŸŒ®</h1>

<p>The world has changed.</p>

<p>I feel it in the lettuce.</p>

<p>I feel it in the salsa.</p>

<p>I smell it in the queso.</p>

<p>It's raining tacos. Tacos are falling from the sky. But who will deliver them?</p>

<p>Fortunately cats stepped forward to save the world from the rain of tacos.</p>

<p>They deliver tacos. They will deliver a taco right to you!</p>

<p>The hero cats who stepped forward contacted developers PATTI and SAM.</p>

<p>The result of this collaboration was TACOCAT.</p>

<p>(TACOCAT's tacos are the most affordable because we don't have to pay the cats)</p>
